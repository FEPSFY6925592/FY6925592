  Using lightweight materials to design a chassis for an electric vehicle, whilst maintaining safety and performance levels has become a key engineering 
  challenge, particularly in Formula E. In this article I will explore the materials and design strategies best suited to enable a lighter, but more efficient 
  chassis system for electric vehicles, utilising knowledge from Formula E technologies.

  Battery capacity and vehicle weight are two key considerations for electric vehicles. Larger batteries increase range, but they also add mass which lowers
  performance. Lighter weight objects are easier to accelerate compared to heavier objects, so they require less energy, therefore less fuel is used, saving costs.
  As a result, lightweight materials are crucial for improving energy efficiency, acceleration and cornering dynamics. All these attributes are critical both on 
  the racetrack for Formula E as well as in consumer EVs.
  
  Formula E provides a unique case study in this regard. Engineers are driven to develop cutting edge materials and structural designs, due to the vehicle’s strict
  energy limits and high-performance demands. <a href="https://www.fia.com/system/files/documents/2025-2026_season_12_formula_e_techregs_wmsc_10.06.2025_eng_fr_marked_up_rev_05.06.25_0.pdf">(FIA,2025,Art.3.6).</a>
  
  The next generation of commercial EVs is increasingly influenced by the lessons learnt in Formula E.

  The chassis serves as the structural backbone of an electric vehicle, supporting loads from the suspension, powertrain and passengers while enhancing crash
  safety and torsional rigidity. In electric race cars the chassis must also include the battery pack, control electronics and cooling systems. <a href =" https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86924-w">(Scientific Reports article)</a>;
  

  The main goals for the design of a Formula E chassis includes:
  
•	Minimising weight to improve acceleration and energy efficiency.
  
•	Maximising Stiffness for predictable handling and ensuring stability at high speeds.
  
•	Ensuring safety in compliance with FIA crash standards.
  
•	Facilitating thermal management of electric components.

In this article I will be discussing 3 main lightweight materials in Formula E chassis design:
  1- Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRB):

      In Formula E, a type of chassis configuration is the carbon-fibre monocoque design. A monocoque is a structural element in which the skin or outer body
      shell is completely load bearing. The external skins are usually constructed using CFRP and the core using a honeycomb cell structure from fibres such as
      Kevlar.  (Carbon Fibre Composite Monocoque Chassis For a Formula Student Race Car- Leon Shi & Kieran Rice 2019).
      CFRB is ideal for monocoque structures due to its high specific strength and stiffness, low density, and excellent fatigue resistance.

      Additionally, Formula E’s material construction regulations specifically allow carbon fibres made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor with a density of
      less than 1.92g/cm^3 and a tensile modulus of less than 550 GPa. As a result, Formula E chassis design permits the use of advanced composites within the
      strictly defined parameters.  (Mraz,2017).


  2- Aluminium and Magnesium Alloys:
      While CFRB makes up the core structure, aluminium and magnesium alloys are frequently used in subframes, suspension arms and battery casings. These metals
      offer a favourable balance between cost, performance and manufacturability.
      Aluminium alloys are commonly used due to their low density (about 2.7 g/cm^3) compared to steel (about 7.8 g/cm^3). They also have a good strength to
      weight ratio. 
      Magnesium alloys, in some applications, can save up to 15% to 20% of the weight of aluminium due to their even lower density (about 2/3 that of aluminium).
      (Singh, 2024)


  3- Hybrid Composite structures:
      New design strategies in high performance EV and racing applications investigate multi material architectures combining CFRP with Kevlar, thermoplastic
      composites or other advanced materials for specific zones, such as crash zones or battery enclosures. For example, combining metallic and composite
      
      materials helps in striking a balance between performance, cost, manufacturability and repairability.

  Lightweight design is not just about material selection. It also relies on finite element analysis (FEA) and topology optimisation. These tools are used by
  engineers to find low stress areas where material can be reduced as well as to help predict crash deformation behaviour in accordance with safety regulations.
  Studies show that using lighter materials and an optimised design could achieve weight reductions of 18% to 35% for chassis/ body structures. Furthermore, under
  BEV assumptions, a simulation study demonstrated that substituting an aluminium or carbon fibre reinforced structure for a steel-based structure led to
  significant mass savings. (Del Pero et al., 2020).

  Production EVs are influenced by technologies developed in Formula E:
  Motorsport fabrication techniques are used in carbon fibre hybrid chassis, such as the BMW i3. For example, a vehicle using CFRP passenger cell achieved mass
  reductions of 250 – 350 kg compared to conventional steel body. (PW Consulting, 2024).
  Moreover, the compact design philosophy of Formula E is mirrored in structural battery integration, where the battery pack contributes to the stiffness of the
  chassis.
  Furthermore, inspired by racing sustainability initiatives, such as bio-based resins and recycled carbon fibres, are being developed for mass production. For
  instance, recycling damaged carbon fibre components is part of Formula E’s net zero carbon by design strategy. (The Official Home of Formula E, 2023).

  Despite the advantages, lightweight materials also face several challenges:

1-	High manufacturing costs and limited recyclability of CFRP. For example, although CFRP can reduce weight by 50% to 70% when compared to steel, the
  environmental impact and material cost can be significant. (Singh, 2024)

  
2-	The procedure for fixing broken composites is complicated.

  
3-	Difficulties with thermal and electrical insulation in EV integration. (specifically for battery packs and structural integration).
  
4-	Sourcing and supply chain risks, especially for advanced composites or magnesium alloys.

  These challenges can be addressed in the future through automated composite manufacturing to reduce cost. Additionally, the use of smart materials with embedded
  sensors would be beneficial to structural health monitoring.  Circular recycling processes would help with carbon fibre recovery and reuse.
